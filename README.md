# user-authentication-app
This is my first mini application using Django. Created the Home page, Login page, Logout page, Register page, Edit Profile page and the Change Password page. With the help of Bootstrap I was able to do something nice with the forms but I hit a wall when I tried customizing the Change Password page. Hopefully, I fix it.
